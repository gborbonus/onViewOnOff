# onViewOnOff

A simple library that allows you to add the tags "sah" and "saho" to your elements.

Anytime an element that has these tags is within view, the sah function will run, and when removed from view, the saho function will run.

saho is not required.

# Options:
By default sah will not run it's function until the bottom left of the element is within view, you can set this to "anything" to make it so any part of the element within view will execute the function.
